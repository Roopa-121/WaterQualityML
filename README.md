Water Quality Prediction using ML
Overview

Access to safe drinking water is vital for human health. Unfortunately, water sources can contain harmful substances such as heavy metals, chemicals, and biological contaminants that make it unsafe.
This project uses Machine Learning to automatically predict whether water is safe (1) or not safe (0) based on chemical and biological properties.

Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — handle duplicates, missing values, and type conversions.

Feature Engineering — compare values against WHO safety thresholds to flag unsafe contaminants.

Exploratory Analysis — understand feature distributions and water quality trends.

Model Training — multiple ML models tested for accuracy (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Prediction — given water sample data, the system outputs safe or unsafe.
